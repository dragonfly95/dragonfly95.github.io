it's time 이제 할 시간이에요
it's time to grow up 성장할
it's time to board your plane 비행기에 탑승할
it's time for a preview of the new product 새 상품에 대한 공개쑈 를 할
it's time for meditation 명상할
it's time for a comeback 돌아갈 (복귀할 )
it's time to calculate the annual profits 연간 소득을 계산할
it's time to pay the bill the supplier sent us 그 공급 회사에서 보낸 계산서에 돈을 지불할
it's time for the patrol to make another round 순찰대가 한 번 더 순찰할
it's time to reorganize the personnel department 인사부를 개편할
it's time for a conference call with management in company headquarters 본사와 전화 회의할
